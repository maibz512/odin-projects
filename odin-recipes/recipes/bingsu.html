   <H2>Description</H2>
   <p>bingsu is made from frozen cream or milk. It’s a type of Korean shaved ice where a block of frozen milk or cream is grated or shaved using a knife to create a fluffy, snow-like dessert.</p>
   
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 ½ cups milk</li>
    <li>½ cup condensed milk, (sub with glucose or corn syrup)</li>
    <li>your choice of toppings (e.g. chopped fruit, red bean, condensed milk, candy, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>n a freezer-safe container, mix the milk and condensed milk together using a whisk.</li>
    <li>Cover the mixture and freeze for at least 5 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>While the mixture is freezing, prepare your toppings. You can chop up some fruits like mangoes, strawberries, kiwi or bananas. Set them aside.</li>
    <li>After the mixture has frozen, remove it from the container and wrap it in some plastic wrap. This will make it easier to hold.</li>
    <li>Hold the wrapped up milk block with a towel to protect your skin and begin shaving it into a bowl using a grater. You can also use a food processor with a grater attachment.</li>
    <li>Add your favourite toppings and drizzle some condensed milk on top. Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
